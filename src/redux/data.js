        The West African slave trade formed one of the most pivotal experiences
        in Africa's history. With the scramble and partition of Africa by the
        Portuguese and other European superpowers in the early 15th century,
        this commenced a dark period of slave trade in the history of West
        Africa.
        <br />
        <br />
        After discovery the coast of West Africa in one of its voyages,
        Portuguese soldiers started to capture Africans and hold them as slaves
        from the coast. Due to its proximity to the water, it was easy for the
        Portuguese to capture Africans and easily ship them to their home
        country.
        <br />
        <br />
        On this journey, we will take you through an in-depth interactive
        experience on the history of slave trade in West Africa, and you will
        attempt to experience some of the harsh realities that have left many

        The slave trade in East Africa really took off from the 17th century. More and
        more merchants from Oman settled in Zanzibar. The island took on an even more
        important role in the international trade of goods due to the large trade at the
        Swahili coast and consequently also in the slave trade. This is how the largest
        slave market in East Africa was created.
        <br />
        <br />
        East Africa was a late participant in the transatlantic slave trade. 
        It was only in he 1770s that a regular trade in slaves to the French islands of Mauritius and
        RÃ©union began from points on the East African coast. Small numbers of slaves had been carried around 
        the Cape for more than a century. But as planters on St Domingue cried out for labour,
        this trade became more profitable and systematic, particularly as the French 
        king agreed to ubsidise the shipment of slaves to the island.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this journey, we will explore the history of slavery in East Africa,

        Despite the flourishing trade relationship, one state in the Benin
        Kingdom, 'Edo', was reluctant to be a part of the transatlantic slave
        trade. The Edo people believed that selling their brothers would have
        consequences on their land.

        The Portuguese took what they could get, and began to trade slaves on

        famous for its trade in slaves, and this marked start of the movement of
